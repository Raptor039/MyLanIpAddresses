# MyLanIpAddresses
Basic script in PowerShell with forms to display informations about LAN IP addresses (v4 and v6) for all active network adapters presents on the device.

# Run
You can simply run the ps1 script as is

# Build
You can build the ps1 to an executable exe file with ps2exe module (ask for install when running build.ps1 if ps2exe module not found on the device) to be more friendly to use!

## How to build :
Edit the build.ps1 file (if you need to customize settings), save and run.
